FuzzyTruck
==========

This is an assigment of the INE5430 - Artificial Intelligence discipline.
Our task is to park a truck using a fuzzy system.

Building/Running
================

The build system is configured to use `C++14`,
so you need a recent version of `gcc` or `clang` to compile this program.
We have tested it with `gcc 4.9.2`.

Just type

    make

Then run

    java -jar jar/fuzzy_truck.jar

to start the GUI server, click on "Iniciar/Reiniciar",
and launch the program `main`.
